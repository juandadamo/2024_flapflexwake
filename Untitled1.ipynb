    "- **Strouhal Frequency**: The Strouhal frequency (derived from forces on the body) does not change significantly. This suggests that the **primary vortex shedding mechanism** is not strongly altered by the flexible foils. However, the foils might still be influencing smaller-scale structures or the energy distribution in the wake.\n",

    "- Look for trends, such as:\n",

    "- **Effect of $C_y$**: Higher $C_y$ values (more flexible foils) likely lead to larger deformations and potentially greater drag reduction, but there may be an upper limit where excessive flexibility reduces effectiveness.\n",
    "- **Strouhal Frequency**: Since the Strouhal frequency remains unchanged, the foils might be disrupting smaller-scale vortices or redistributing energy in the wake without altering the primary shedding frequency.\n",
    "- **Optimal Foil Configuration**: Identify the foil thickness and length that provide the best drag reduction for a given flow velocity, based on $C_y$.\n",
